# stamp-build.sh — set this app's BUILD NUMBER to the repository's commit count.
#
# ─── THE STANDARD ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Michael, 2026-09-04: "lets make that number the build number of the app from now on
# so it is uniform viewable in the app in xcode and app store connect. legally without
# it being a debugging artifact that flags rejection."
#
#     CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = git rev-list --count HEAD
#
# WHY THE COMMIT COUNT AND NOT THE SHA. CFBundleVersion must be period-separated
# non-negative integers, and App Store Connect requires every upload to be numerically
# HIGHER than the last in its version train. A SHA is a hash — 0x68c0c9d is 109841565,
# but the next commit could hash lower and Apple would refuse the upload. The commit
# count increments by one per commit, never goes down on a branch, is an integer, and
# names a commit. Michael got this right when I had steered away from it: "githubs
# number has to increase and not go down becaue it has to be a counter number."
#
# It is ordinary version metadata. No review risk.
#
# ─── WHY NOT AN XCODE BUILD PHASE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# Projects created by recent Xcode set ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING = YES, and a
# sandboxed Run Script phase cannot read .git or write into the built product. Turning
# that off to gain a version label trades a real security boundary for a convenience.
# So the stamp is written before the build instead of during it, by a post-commit hook.
#
# ─── PROJECT-AGNOSTIC ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Finds the .xcodeproj itself, so one copy works in every repo including future ones.
# If the project has a BuildStamp.swift it fills that in too; if not, the build number
# alone still works and the in-app display is the only thing missing.
#
# Absolute path to git: a hook does not inherit an interactive shell's PATH.

# ── THE COUNT CAN REPEAT, SO THE COUNT ALONE IS NOT A NAME ────────────────────────
#
# Michael, 2026-09-07: "use 84.2 to resolve conflict in names."
#
# `rev-list --count` names the commit only while history moves forward. Discard a build
# and commit over it — his own Shell Citadel rule, "any edits after we discard back to
# the current build" — and the NEXT commit lands on the same count as the one thrown
# away. That happened this morning: the rolled-back 84 and its replacement were both
# "build 84", which is exactly the confusion the whole standard exists to end.
#
# Discarded builds are not deleted here, they are TAGGED (broken-84, stable-83), so the
# collision is already recorded in the repository and does not need to be remembered.
# Count the tags that sit at this same commit-count on a DIFFERENT commit; if any do,
# this is the (k+1)th build to wear the number and it says so: 84 -> 84.2.
#
# ⛔ NOT HAND-STAMPED, AND THAT IS THE POINT. A number typed in once "just this once" is
# the complacency he named. This is derived, so it stays right on its own.
# CFBundleVersion allows period-separated integers, so 84.2 is valid where a SHA is not.
