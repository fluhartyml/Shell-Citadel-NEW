//  CredentialStore.swift
//  Shell Citadel
//
//  The password lives in the Keychain and nowhere else.
//
//  WHY NOT UserDefaults: UserDefaults is a plist in the app container — plain text,
//  included in backups, readable by anything that gets at the container. A host key
//  fingerprint can live there because it is a value to COMPARE against, not a secret.
//  A password that opens a shell on someone's Mac cannot.
//
//  `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` is deliberate on both halves:
//  WhenUnlocked means a locked phone in someone else's hands does not give up the
//  password, and ThisDeviceOnly keeps it out of iCloud Keychain and out of backups,
//  so it cannot follow a restore onto a device the owner no longer controls.
//
//  The password is never logged, never put in an error message, and never written
//  into the transcript — the shell command built in SSHSession contains the text the
//  user typed, never the credential.
