//
//  Dictation.swift
//  Shell Citadel
//
//  THE LISTENING HALF OF HANDS FREE.
//
//  Michael, 2026-08-31 17:31, overruling a design I had just argued for:
//  "the app is not armed to go hands free untill i tap both the speaker on and the
//  microphone."
//
//  I had proposed the microphone arming ITSELF whenever the app was open, on the
//  grounds that a tap is not hands free. He was right to overrule it. Arming is not
//  the part that has to be hands free — the CONVERSATION is. And a terminal that
//  starts listening the moment it is opened is a microphone you did not ask for.
//  Two deliberate taps, then it is his.
//
//  Then, 17:32: "does it type what i say and enter when i stop talking?" — yes, and
//  that is the whole interaction:
//
//      speak → words appear in the composer → you stop → it sends
//
//  ⚠️ THE PAUSE IS A SETTING, NOT A CONSTANT. 17:33: "should we have a sensitivity?"
//  Half-second steps from 0.5 to 5 (17:36), because anything finer is false precision
//  on a measurement of how long a person takes to think. It lives with the speech
//  settings and not behind a long press: it is set once and never touched again, and a
//  hidden gesture for that is a control nobody finds. He had already failed to find a
//  toggle sitting in plain sight two sheets down.
//
//  ⚠️ FOREGROUND ONLY, AND THIS IS A REAL LIMIT, NOT A DETAIL.
//  iOS will not keep a third-party microphone open with the screen locked without the
//  `audio` background mode, which is a claim about the app that App Review reads
//  closely. So this covers "app open, AirPods in". It does NOT cover the phone in a
//  pocket at three in the morning — that is what the Siri intents are for, and it is
//  why the two mechanisms are not redundant. → [[VoiceIntents]]
//
//  ⚠️ ON DEVICE. `SFSpeechRecognizer` is asked for on-device recognition explicitly.
//  Nothing said in this room goes to a server for transcription. That is not a nicety
//  in an app whose entire premise is that it talks to a machine the user already owns
//  with no account and no phone-home. → [[Connection]]
